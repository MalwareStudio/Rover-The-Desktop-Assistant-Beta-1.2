//welcome message
Since this is the first time we've met, I want to tell you something about myself. My name is Rover and I am your new desktop assistant. I can help, entertain, search and most importantly talk to you. My author equipped me with great features such as GDI. It is a very interesting feature that you must try. By the way, I'm a very nice and friendly dog, you don't have to worry you fucker. hahaha. I hope we can get along because I want to be friend with you. If something happens or you need help. I'm always here for you. Well, I won't delay because I know you are looking forward to the great features I have to offer. Let's have some fun.

Oh you again? Today is going to be a long day
You look like shit, you think like shit, everything about you is shit
I hope you won't be annoying again today. If so, I'll kick your ass
Welcome back boring ass
